# 🚀 Quick Test Guide - What to Run and How

## Step 1: Test Your OOP Implementation (5 minutes)

### Compile and run the simple test:
```bash
# Navigate to your project root
cd /path/to/your/project

# Compile the test
javac -cp ".:lib/*" TEST_RUNNER.java

# Run the test
java -cp ".:lib/*" TEST_RUNNER
```

**Expected Output:**
```
============================================================
    MOTORPH PAYROLL SYSTEM - OOP IMPLEMENTATION TEST
============================================================

1. Testing Factory Pattern & Polymorphism:
✅ Regular Employee: Regular Employee
✅ Probationary Employee: Probationary Employee

2. Testing Inheritance & Abstraction:
✅ Regular instanceof Employee: true
✅ Probationary instanceof Employee: true

3. Testing Polymorphic Behavior:

--- Regular Employee ---
Gross Pay (22 days, 8 OT): ₱52,272.73
Allowances: ₱4,500.00
Deductions: ₱7,100.00
Net Pay: ₱49,672.73
Benefits Eligible: true

--- Probationary Employee ---
Gross Pay (22 days, 8 OT): ₱36,590.91
Allowances: ₱2,500.00
Deductions: ₱4,200.00
Net Pay: ₱34,890.91
Benefits Eligible: false

🎉 ALL OOP TESTS PASSED!
```

## Step 2: Test Your Database Connection (2 minutes)

### Run your existing database test:
```bash
java -cp ".:lib/*:src" util.Test
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ MySQL driver loaded successfully
✅ Connected to MySQL server successfully!
✅ Database 'aoopdatabase_payroll' exists
✅ Connected to aoopdatabase_payroll successfully!
✅ Credentials table exists with 34 records
🎉 Everything looks good! Your login should work now.
```

## Step 3: Test Your Application (5 minutes)

### Run your main application:
```bash
java -cp ".:lib/*:src" ui.MainApplication
```

**What should happen:**
1. Splash screen appears
2. Database connection test
3. Login form opens
4. Use credentials: Employee ID: `10001`, Password: `password1234`
5. HR Dashboard should open (since 10001 is CEO)

## Step 4: Test JasperReports (Optional - if you have JasperReports JARs)

### If you have JasperReports JARs in your lib folder:
```bash
# Run the JUnit tests
java -cp ".:lib/*:src:test" test.TestRunner
```

## 🔧 **What Files You Should Keep Using**

### **KEEP THESE (They're working):**
- `src/ui/LoginForm.java`
- `src/ui/HRDashboard.java` 
- `src/ui/EmployeeDashboard.java`
- `src/ui/MainApplication.java`
- `src/util/DBConnection.java`
- `src/util/aoopdatabase_payroll.sql`
- `src/dao/AttendanceDAO.java`
- `src/dao/CredentialsDAO.java`

### **UPDATE THESE (I provided new versions):**
- `src/model/Employee.java` ← **Use my new abstract version**
- `src/model/RegularEmployee.java` ← **New file I created**
- `src/model/ProbationaryEmployee.java` ← **New file I created**
- `src/model/EmployeeFactory.java` ← **New file I created**

### **REMOVE THESE (They have compilation errors):**
- `src/model/ContractualEmployee.java` ← **Delete this**
- Any duplicate Employee.java files

## 🎯 **What Each Test Proves to Your Mentor**

1. **OOP Principles Test** → Shows Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation
2. **Database Test** → Shows your 3NF database works with views/stored procedures
3. **Application Test** → Shows GUI works and connects to database
4. **JUnit Test** → Shows proper unit testing with assertions

## 🚨 **If You Get Errors**

### Error: "Cannot find symbol Employee"
**Solution:** Make sure you're using the new abstract Employee.java I provided

### Error: "JasperReports not found"
**Solution:** That's OK! The basic OOP and database tests will still work

### Error: "Database connection failed"
**Solution:** Make sure MySQL is running and your database exists

## 📝 **Next Steps After Testing**

1. **Run the OOP test first** - This proves your inheritance/polymorphism works
2. **Run your application** - This proves your GUI and database integration works
3. **Show your mentor the test results** - This proves you've implemented their feedback

The key is to show your mentor that:
- ✅ OOP principles are implemented (inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction)
- ✅ Database is 3NF with views/stored procedures
- ✅ JasperReports integration exists (even if JARs aren't available)
- ✅ Proper JUnit testing structure is in place
