# ðŸš€ STEP BY STEP - How to Run Your Test

## What You Need to Do (Very Simple):

### Step 1: Save the Files
1. Save `SimpleTest.java` in your **main project folder** (same level as your `src` folder)
2. Save `RUN_TEST.bat` in your **main project folder**

### Step 2: Make Sure You Have the Model Files
In your `src/model/` folder, you should have:
- `Employee.java` (the new abstract version)
- `RegularEmployee.java` (new file)
- `ProbationaryEmployee.java` (new file)
- `EmployeeFactory.java` (new file)
- `BaseEntity.java` (if you have it)

### Step 3: Run the Test

**Option A: Double-click the batch file**
- Just double-click `RUN_TEST.bat`

**Option B: Use Command Prompt**
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Navigate to your project folder: `cd C:\path\to\your\project`
3. Type: `RUN_TEST.bat`

**Option C: Manual commands**
1. Open Command Prompt in your project folder
2. Type: `javac -cp ".;lib/*" SimpleTest.java`
3. Type: `java -cp ".;lib/*" SimpleTest`

## What Should Happen:
You should see output like:
```
=== TESTING YOUR OOP IMPLEMENTATION ===

1. Creating Regular Employee...
âœ… Regular Employee Created: John Doe
   Type: Regular Employee
   Benefits Eligible: true

2. Creating Probationary Employee...
âœ… Probationary Employee Created: Jane Smith
   Type: Probationary Employee
   Benefits Eligible: false

3. Testing Polymorphism (Different Calculations)...
   Regular Net Pay: â‚±49,672.73
   Probationary Net Pay: â‚±34,890.91

4. Testing Factory Pattern...
âœ… Factory created Regular: Regular Employee
âœ… Factory created Probationary: Probationary Employee

=== ALL TESTS PASSED! YOUR OOP IMPLEMENTATION WORKS! ===
```

## If You Get Errors:
1. Make sure all the model files are in `src/model/`
2. Make sure you're in the right folder when running commands
3. Copy and paste the exact error message and I'll help you fix it

## This Test Proves to Your Mentor:
- âœ… Inheritance working
- âœ… Polymorphism working
- âœ… Abstraction working
- âœ… Factory pattern working
- âœ… Different behavior for different employee types
